# Umbra Hangman (v1.0)

This is the webpage source code for my custom hangman game! This is my first project using ReactJS. It took me about one month to create and is completely original work.
Meaning no outside sources were used for things like graphic design, UI layout, or anything else. This was created in my Freshmen year of 2021-2022.

#### -> Here is a link to the deployed webpage:  [umbra100-hangman.netlify.app](https://umbra100-hangman.netlify.app/)

## Feature List
* **54** Different words to guess
* **Changeable** Difficulty, hint count, and chance count.
* **Fun** Interactive menus and UI.
* **Can** be played with just a keyboard or just a mouse only.
