# Umbra Hangman (v1.0)

This is the webpage source code for my custom hangman game! This is my first project using React JS. It took me about one month to create and is completely original work.
Meaning no outside sources were used for things like graphic design, UI layout or anything else. And I am proud to say as of 2021-2022 this is my best project.

#### -> Here is a link to the deployed webpage:  [umbra100-hangman.netlify.app](https://umbra100-hangman.netlify.app/)
